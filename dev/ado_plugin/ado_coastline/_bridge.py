"""Locate and import COASTLINE's public recommender facade.

COASTLINE is distributed as ``coastline-recommender`` and ships a stable public
facade -- ``import coastline`` exposes ``coastline.Coastline`` (and
``coastline.recommend``) -- on top of the ``coastline_recommender`` pipeline and the
shared ``coastline_common`` data models. Once it is installed
(``pip install coastline-recommender``, or ``pip install -e <coastline checkout>``
for local dev) a plain ``import coastline`` is all this plugin needs, and that is the
preferred path: the plugin talks to the facade, not to pipeline internals.

For the umbrella monorepo dev layout (``<umbrella>/{ado,coastline,kavier}``) where
COASTLINE may not be pip-installed yet, we fall back to putting a sibling ``coastline``
checkout -- and its ``kavier`` physics engine -- on ``sys.path`` before importing.

The import is performed lazily (inside the experiment functions, not at module
import) so the ado plugin still *registers* even when COASTLINE is absent.
